*Setup Instructions*

After you clone the repository to your machine, create your virtual environment (you should only need to do this once, the first time you open the project):

$ python -m venv .venv

To activate your local environment (you must do this every time you work on the project):

$ .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

Once the environment is activated, install all the needed dependencies:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
